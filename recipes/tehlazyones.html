    <h2>The Best Version of an Egg! (and the laziest way to make them!)</h2>
    
    <p>A simple recipe (the simplest?). 
        Steaming an egg is one of the many ways to cook one; however, 
        I have dubbed this way as "TehLazyOne", in honor of my late friend, 
        and because it describes how these are the laziest way to make eggs! 
        No work required, just crack them open and come back in a few minutes!
