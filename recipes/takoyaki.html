    <h2>Japan's best fried snack! (according to me &#x1F60B;)</h2>
    
    <p>I just love these fried balls of octopus! Although they don't have to contain octopus pieces, the "Tako" in the name means octopus in Japanese, so to me it's not right without them! Although I have had some ebiyaki (ebi=shrimp), that was bomb! Unfortunately most restaurants that offer takoyaki just buy them frozen and reheat them. Still tastes great, but after having them made right in front of you, the frozen ones can't compare! So let's make them fresh and fill them up with your preffered filling!</p>
    
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Octopus/Shrimp/Filling of your choice</li>
        <li>Green Onions (optional)</li>
        <li>2 Eggs</li>

            <li>120g Flour</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Oil/Butter of Choice (to avoid sticking to Takoyaki Pan)</li>

        <li>Pour more batter into pan until each is just overflowing</li>
        <li>When the batter starts to get solid, start flipping the balls</li>
        <li>Use a scooping motion to flip the balls 90&#xb0;, then tuck the rest in</li>
        <li>Flip the balls periodically to evenly cook them</li>
